# SLICE-3D Skin Cancer Detection - Datathon
Slice 3D is an AI-powered pipeline designed to aid early skin cancer detection by analyzing 3D total body photography. Our model predicts the likelihood of malignant lesions and supports triaging in clinical settings, especially in underserved populations.

## About the Project

This project was inspired by the need for **early skin cancer detection**, especially in **underserved populations** with limited access to dermatological care. Using a dataset of 3D total body images, we built a machine learning pipeline to **analyze lesion-level missingness** and identify trends that could impact model performance and bias.

We used **R for exploratory data analysis and visualization**, diving deep into variable completeness across patient records. This helped us understand which clinical features are reliable and where improvements are needed in data collection.
